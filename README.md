# Pocket-Based Drug Design

## Introduction
This repository focuses on drug design using pocket-based methods that utilize the detailed structural information of protein binding sites to generate appropriate ligands. Our approach leverages advanced AI algorithms to model the interactions between ligands and proteins, which facilitates the creation of molecules optimally configured for their target sites.

## Pocket-Based Algorithms
We employ several state-of-the-art algorithms including:
- **DiffSBDD**: A diffusion model that generates novel ligands with high predicted binding affinities. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/arneschneuing/DiffSBDD.git)
- **DrugGPT**: An autoregressive model using GPT for ligand design that explores vast chemical spaces. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/LIYUESEN/druggpt.git)
- **Lingo3DMol**: Utilizes a transformer-based approach for 3D molecular structure generation. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/stonewiseAIDrugDesign/Lingo3DMol.git)
- **Pocket2Mol**: An E(3)-equivariant generative network that efficiently samples molecular structures. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/pengxingang/Pocket2Mol.git)
- **RGA**: A reinforced genetic algorithm optimizing molecular designs for enhanced binding affinity. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/futianfan/reinforced-genetic-algorithm.git)

## Evaluation Metrics
Our frameworks are evaluated based on several metrics, including:
- **Virtual Docking**: Simulation of molecule and protein/enzyme interactions. [View on GitHub] (https://github.com/coleygroup/pyscreener.git)
- **Pharmacological Activity**: Measures the biological effects of drug molecules. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/diegolfor9/pCHEMBL-prediction.git)
- **Toxicity**: Determine the safety and viability of molecules. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop.git)
- **Quantitative Estimation of Drug Likeness (QED)**: Indicates the likelihood of a molecule being a successful drug.
- **Lipophilicity (LogP)**: Indicates the molecule's ability to penetrate cell membranes.
- **Molecular Weight and Diversity**: Critical for assessing pharmacokinetics and structural variety.

## Results
We analyze the performance of different molecular generation models using the above metrics, with special attention to their ability to generate diverse, innovative molecules that could serve as potential therapeutic agents.
